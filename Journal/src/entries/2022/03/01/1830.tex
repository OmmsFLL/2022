\newentry{\time{}}{Meeting}{1.5 hours}

Tonight's focus is on building robots and getting familiar with Python programming.  The builders are working on new designs, and coders are learning how to code, build, and make changes to python source code.  The coders were allowed to explore the API documented at \url{https://pybricks.com/ev3-micropython/}, and make the robot do whatever they wanted.  This consisted mostly of playing sounds, and moving forwards/backwards and turning.  We put the table up, but did not put a mat down.  This allowed them to get used to the development cycle of changing code, debugging errors, build and running code, and reading the web documentation listing out what all can be programmed from python.  Three laptops were available for the coders, along with three robots.  The robots were configured with USB wifi dongles and a microsd card with the official lego sponsored build of ev3dev.  Each of the three microsd cards were pre-programmed with modified hostnames so that we could connnect to the correct robot.

This session was a pretty good success, but direction needs to be provided to both the builders and the coders so that they can move towards a finished product we can use for competition next year.  For next meeting, make sure there are a list of ``challenges'' for the both builders and coders to work towards solving.
